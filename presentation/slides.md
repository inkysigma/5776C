# horizontal claw

## { optimized for cones }
* can be stacked higher
	* gripped from bottom
	* greater margin for error
* any orientation
* easier access to perimeter



# The Bot
## {made for reliability}

- consistent > faster + inconsistent
- better outcome



# The Lift
## {gear-linked, reverse double four bar}

- easier tuning
- faster fixes


- faster than mechanically linked
- triangle band for support



# The Lift
## { offset four-bar }
- increases height
- faster than mini chain-bar
- linear movement
- rubber band assist
	- faster movement



# The Intake
## {sideways four-bar}

- Better than a chain bar
 - physical connection = no desync
- Centralizes center of mass


- Takes up vertical space: bracing
 - increased spacing
 - increased height capability



# The Code
## {Made with PROS}
- PID to stabilize lift and offset four-bar
- Autostack function quickly stacks cones


# Advantages over  ROBOTC
- cross-platform
- computationally efficient
- easier to debug syntax
- better support for version control
- extension libraries
- GCC optimization
