/**
 * @file core/motors.h
 *
 * @brief This file contains the core functionality of the motors by creating
 *        methods to interact with components rather than motors directly.
 *
 *        e.g moveMotor(int left, int right) will move the left and right sides
 *            with the power supplied.
 *
 *        This file is not recompiled when you change it. Thus running make clean
 *        is necessary.
 *
 *        IMPORTANT: If you change this file, run make clean to delete old
 *                   binaries. Given that this problem has occurred multiple
 *                   times, I cannot stress that you need to run make clean
 *
 *        TL;DR make clean
