  * The classical error-based closed-loop feedback controller is implemented in by fbc functions.
  * For simplicity and convenience, some naming conventions have been adopted to lower the learning curve.
  *
  * fbc provides mechanisms to interact with closed loop controllers and implements the basic feedback
  * controller plant (move), sensor (sense), and controller (compute) transfer functions. Additionally,
  * fbc determines if the system is on target through the use of a acceptTolerance and acceptConfidence.
  * acceptTolerance is the maximum error from the current sensor state to the goal state to be considered
  * on target. acceptConfidence determines the number of iterations the controller must be contiguously on
  * target to be considered stable and on target.
